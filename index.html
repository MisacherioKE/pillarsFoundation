        <h2>Our history</h2>
        <p id="aboutText">
          Together, we have a combined history of over 3 years’ experience in advocacy, lobbying, membership growth, support and capacity building, and working with sector partners. By merging, we are able to offer a range of services for members, government and the wider sector. A key strength of Pillars Care is that we work with and support a diverse membership base across the whole of the Kenya, working across both urban and rural settings. 
          Our members operate across a wide spectrum, offering services including Green Care, community and social based activities. There is often considerable crossover in delivery different settings. For example, a community farm may be involved in both community development and care farming activities. By focusing on the services or activities delivered or facilitated by our members, rather than the physical form upon which our members operate (e.g. a farm, garden, school, orchard), we aim to widen the opportunities open to our members and the wider sector.
          
          
          <h2>Improving People's Lives</h2>
          Many people assume that community gardens and city or care farms are just nice places to visit where plants are grown and animals kept. But that is far from the whole picture.
          Many of them also offer an amazing array of benefits and opportunities, which can include education programs, play schemes, healthy living initiatives, work and skills training, social enterprises, volunteer opportunities, environmental schemes, horticultural therapy groups, facilities for people with disabilities…the list goes on and on!
         
          <h2> Our work helps:</h2>
          •	200 villages and school farms <br>
          •	1,000 community gardens <br>
          •	All the Kenya - migori care farms <br>
          •	Hundreds of farms and gardens in development <br>
          Between them our members engage and empower thousands of volunteers and attract over 5000 visitors each year. Their estimated combined annual turnover is in excess of 10,000 visitors
          
          <h2>Growing Communities</h2>
          "Joining Pillars Care Foundation is the best thing we did. They have helped us with our constitution and advised on charitable status. Being part of a wide network it has given us credibility."
         
          <h2> Growing People</h2>
          "It has been a great source of pleasure to me to watch this organization become a real force for good in recent years, not least in the development of national 
          
          
          Policy. I hope and pray that this will continue for the next thirty years because there is no doubt in my mind that its work is only going to grow in importance."
